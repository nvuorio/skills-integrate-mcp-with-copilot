# Issue Drafts for frontend integration

The following are draft GitHub issues to integrate a simple RSVP/frontend into this repository. Copy-paste these into GitHub Issues or use the `gh` CLI to create them.

---

## 1) Implement frontend scaffold to list activities and RSVP

**Summary**

Add a small React SPA (served from `static/` or `frontend/`) that lists activities from the existing backend `/activities` endpoint and allows users to RSVP by calling `POST /activities/{activity_name}/signup?email=...`.

**Acceptance criteria**
- `static/` contains built frontend files or a `frontend/` directory with a CRA project.
- Frontend fetches `/activities` and displays activity name, description, schedule, current participant count, and max participants.
- Each activity has an "RSVP" button that sends a POST to the signup endpoint and shows success/error feedback.
- README updated with run instructions.

**Labels:** enhancement, frontend

**Estimate:** 3-5 points

## 2) Add CORS and environment-configured API base URL

**Summary**

Allow the frontend to call the backend from a browser. Replace hard-coded API URL in `apiInstance` with environment variable support, and enable CORS in the FastAPI app.

**Acceptance criteria**
- FastAPI configured with `fastapi.middleware.cors.CORSMiddleware` allowing the frontend origin(s).
- Frontend reads `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL` (or similar) from env; `apiInstance` no longer hardcodes `http://localhost:4000/api/v1`.
- Documentation added to README showing required env vars.

**Labels:** backend, infra

**Estimate:** 1-2 points

---

## 3) Implement event/club endpoints or map frontend to `/activities`

**Summary**

The RSVP frontend expects separate event/club endpoints. Decide between adding backend routes (`/events`, `/clubs`, `/activities/:id`) or updating the frontend to use existing `/activities`.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Either new endpoints are added (with JSON shapes consumed by the frontend) or frontend components updated to use `/activities`.
- API docs updated to show new endpoints or mapping table.

**Labels:** backend, frontend, design

**Estimate:** 2-4 points

---

## 4) Wire up RSVP/Signup flow with validation and limit enforcement

**Summary**

Ensure the backend enforces `max_participants` and returns appropriate errors; frontend should handle and display these errors.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Backend rejects signups once `max_participants` reached with a 400 response and informative message.
- Frontend shows error messages and disables RSVP when full.
- Tests added for signup limit behavior.

**Labels:** backend, frontend, bug

**Estimate:** 2-3 points

---

## 5) Add simple authentication endpoints and integrate login UI

**Summary**

Implement basic auth (JWT or OAuth) endpoints so the frontend `Login` page can be wired. Optionally, support Google sign-in via Firebase or OAuth2.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Backend exposes `/auth/login` (and `/auth/google` or OAuth flow) returning JWT tokens.
- `apiInstance` supports attaching Authorization header.
- Frontend stores token securely (in memory or secure cookie) and uses it for protected actions (like RSVP if required).
- README documents auth flow and env config for OAuth keys.

**Labels:** backend, frontend, security

**Estimate:** 5-8 points

---

## 6) Improve developer tooling: CI, tests, and build steps

**Summary**

Replace pre-push build with CI workflow and add unit tests for backend routes and frontend components.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Add GitHub Actions workflow to run tests and build on push/PR.
- Move from running `npm run build` on pre-push to CI-based checks.
- Add basic tests for `GET /activities`, signup/unregister flows, and for the frontend core components.

**Labels:** infra, tests

**Estimate:** 3-5 points

### How to create these issues

1. With the GitHub web UI: copy a title and body into a new issue and submit.
2. With the GitHub CLI (example):

```bash
# create issue interactively
gh issue create --title "Implement frontend scaffold to list activities and RSVP" --body "$(sed -n '1,80p' ISSUES_DRAFTS.md)"
```

Or open this file in the repo and copy/paste each section into new issues.
